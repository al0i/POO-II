# POO-II

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python-blue)](https://www.python.org/)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the **Object-Oriented Programming II (POO-II)** project, developed by user "al0i". The project consists of a game or simulation that involves the following core components:

* **Ball:** Created randomly on the screen and moves independently.
* **Paddle:** Protects the player's side of the screen and can move autonomously if not controlled by a player.
* **Player:** Responsible for controlling the "Paddle" through their decisions.

The project demonstrates a well-structured, object-oriented design, including a UML Class Diagram for architecture visualization.

## Technologies Used

* **Python** (100% of the codebase)

## Components

### Ball

The ball is generated at random positions on the screen, and its movement is independent.

### Paddle

The paddle's function is to protect the player's side of the screen. It can be controlled by the player or move autonomously.

### Player

The player is responsible for making the decisions that guide the paddle's movement.
